> **Horror look. Comedy feel. Paperwork runs reality.**

A 3D low-poly absurdist narrative job simulation where bureaucracy bends the fabric of existence. PG-13 uncanny vibes — no gore, just existential dread delivered through diegetic UI: tickets, rules, and ominous system toasts.

## ✨ Features

- 🎫 **Diegetic UI Comedy** — Humor delivered through in-world tickets, byzantine rule systems, and passive-aggressive system notifications
- 🏢 **Absurdist Bureaucracy** — Process paperwork that subtly (or not so subtly) alters reality itself
- 🎨 **Low-Poly Aesthetic** — Deliberately uncanny 3D visuals that walk the line between cozy and unsettling
- 📋 **Narrative Job Sim** — Your choices matter... assuming you filled out Form 27-B/6 correctly
- 🔮 **Documentation-First Development** — Building the lore before the code
