# Contributing to The Stamp Office

Thanks for helping build **The Stamp Office** 🖇️  
This repo is **documentation-first** right now (design + data + tools), so contributions are welcome even without engine code.

## Quick Start (Fork → Branch → PR)
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch:
   - `git checkout -b docs/your-change`
3. Make changes
4. Commit with a clear message (see below)
5. Push and open a Pull Request

## Where to Contribute
- `docs/` — design docs, lore, specs, shift scripts
- `data/` — JSON for tickets/rules/toasts (later)
- `prompts/` — LLM prompts for generating content/assets
- `tools/` — validators, generators, helper scripts
- `game/` — engine project (planned)

## Conventional Commits
Use one of these prefixes:
- `feat:` new feature (later, when we have code)
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `chore:` repo maintenance
- `data:` data files (tickets/rules/toasts)
- `tools:` scripts & tooling

Examples:

- [ ] Markdown renders correctly (headings, links, code fences)
- [ ] No references to real brands/teams/people (project policy)
- [ ] Any text meant for UI is short and readable
