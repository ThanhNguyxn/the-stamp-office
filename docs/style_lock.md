# Style Lock

This document defines what The Stamp Office **must** feel like—and what it must never become.

---

## Must-Have Keywords
- Uncanny
- Mundane horror
- Absurdist
- Diegetic humor
- Low-poly charm
- PG-13 unsettling

---

## Forbidden List
❌ Gore, body horror, or visceral violence  
❌ Real brands, teams, or people  
❌ Copyrighted memes or templates  
❌ Jump scares as primary mechanic  
❌ Edgy nihilism without comedic payoff  
❌ Fourth-wall breaks that explain the joke

## Camera Rules
| Context | Camera Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|
| Default | Fixed isometric, slight tilt |
| Ticket focus | Subtle zoom, depth blur |
| Glitch events | Brief shake, snap back |
| Endings | Slow pull-out, fade to black |

- **No handheld wobble**
- **No first-person segments** (unless secret ending)

---

## UI Rules
- **All on-screen text ≤ 8 words**
- System toasts appear bottom-right, fade after 3 seconds
- Tickets use serif font; system UI uses monospace
- No tutorial pop-ups—rules are diegetic (in-world documents)
- Error messages should be cryptic but funny

**Examples:**
| ✅ Good | ❌ Too Long |
|--------|------------|
| "Request denied. Try again never." | "Your request has been denied by the system. Please do not attempt to submit again." |
| "Stamp applied. Fate sealed." | "The stamp has been successfully applied to the ticket." |

---

## Lighting Rules
- **Baseline:** Warm fluorescent office hum
- **Tension:** Flicker, color temperature drops
- **Glitch:** Brief desaturation, harsh shadows
- **Never fully dark**—unease, not blindness

---

## Audio Rules
| Element | Style |
|---------|-------|
| Ambient | Office hum, distant typing, AC drone |
| Stamps | Satisfying thunk, slight reverb |
| Toasts | Soft ping, almost clinical |
| Tension | Low drone, subtle static |
| Comedy beats | Silence before punchline, then normal resume |

- **No sudden loud stingers**
- Music is rare—used only for endings and key moments
