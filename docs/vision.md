# Vision

## One-Liner Pitch
**Horror look. Comedy feel. Paperwork runs reality.**

A 3D low-poly absurdist narrative job sim where you stamp tickets, follow shifting rules, and discover that bureaucracy is the only thing holding the universe together.

---

## Three Pillars

1. **Diegetic Comedy**  
   All humor lives in the world—tickets, system toasts, rule updates. The player finds the joke; we don't explain it.

2. **Escalating Absurdity**  
   Each shift introduces stranger requests. Reality destabilizes as paperwork breaks down.

3. **Player-Driven Pacing**  
   No timer pressure. Players explore, experiment, and clip-bait themselves.

---

## Target Playtime
**90–120 minutes** for a first playthrough (one ending).

## 10-Shift Structure

| Shift | Theme |
|-------|-------|
| 01 | Tutorial — learn stamping, meet The Office |
| 02 | First curveball — contradictory rule introduced |
| 03 | Visitor from another department |
| 04 | Equipment malfunction, improvised solutions |
| 05 | Mid-game twist — new ticket category |
| 06 | Escalation — reality glitches appear |
| 07 | The Office speaks directly to you |
| 08 | Choose your loyalties |
| 09 | Consequences cascade |
| 10 | Final stamp — ending determined |

## Endings Summary

### Ending A — The Good Employee
You followed the rules. The Office is pleased. Reality remains... stable enough.

### Ending B — The Rogue Clerk
You broke protocol. The system fractures. You become something else.

### Secret Ending — ████████
Triggered by a hidden sequence across shifts. Unlocks bonus lore.
