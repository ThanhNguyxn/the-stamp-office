# SHIFT 10 — The Final Stamp

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Quiet before the end. Every stamp matters.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Rulebook Decision** — The rulebook itself requires your stamp. Your final choices determine which ending you receive.

---

## Horror Beat
The room is silent. No hum. No typing. Just you and the tickets. For the first time, you can hear yourself breathing.

---

## Comedy Beat
Final system toast before credits:  
> "Paperwork complete. Reality persists. Somehow."

---

## Special Customer

**No One**  
No special customer appears. The desk is exactly as you left it yesterday. Everything is in order. That's what's wrong.
