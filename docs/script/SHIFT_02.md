# SHIFT 02 — Policy Update

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Contradictions begin. Doubt creeps in.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**MAYBE Stamp** — For tickets that could go either way. Introduces ambiguity. The Office will "decide later."

---

## Horror Beat
A rule popup appears mid-shift that directly contradicts Rule 2 from Shift 01. The old rule remains visible. Neither is removed. A dial-up modem screech plays for 0.5 seconds.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast after first MAYBE stamp:  
> "Decision postponed. Coward's choice noted."

---

## Special Customer

**Kevin from Accounting**  
You never see Kevin. You only see tickets *about* Kevin. He's been employee of the month for 47 consecutive months. His desk is empty. Everyone loves Kevin. Kevin appreciates your support.

## Rule Popups

| # | Rule Text (≤8 words) |
|---|---------------------|
| 1 | "MAYBE stamps delay decisions indefinitely." |
| 2 | "Requests from Level 7 require extra review." |
| 3 | "Contradictory rules resolve themselves. Eventually." |
| 4 | "Do not acknowledge the inconsistency." |

> **Note:** Rule 2 here contradicts Shift 01's "Level 7 always approved." This is intentional.
