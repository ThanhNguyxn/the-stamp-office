# SHIFT 04 — Qualified Approval

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Compromise enters the system. Nothing is absolute.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Two-Step Notes** — New stamp modifiers appear: VALID-ISH, UNDER PROTEST, CLOSE ENOUGH. Apply after main stamp to add conditions.

---

## Horror Beat
The stamp drawer opens by itself mid-shift. A new stamp is inside. It wasn't there before. The drawer closes slowly.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast after stamping APPROVED + UNDER PROTEST:  
> "Request granted. Reluctantly. Very reluctantly."

---

## Special Customer

**The Mediator**  
A figure in gray. Speaks only in compromises. "Yes, but also no." "Partially approved pending full denial." Delivers a ticket that requires all three modifiers simultaneously. Smiles. Has too many teeth.
