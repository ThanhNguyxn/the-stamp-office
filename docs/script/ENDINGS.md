# Endings

Three endings. Two are obvious. One is hidden.

---

## Ending A — Clock Out

### Trigger Condition
Complete Shift 10 with a **Contradiction Meter below 50%** and **Mood Meter above 50%**.  
Translation: Follow the rules. Keep people happy. Be a good employee.

### Description
You stamp the final ticket. The lights dim. A slow, warm fade. The intercom thanks you for your service. Your desk lamp turns off. Credits roll over soft office ambiance.

You were a model employee. The Office is pleased. Reality remains... stable enough.

### Final On-Screen Text
> "Thank you for your service. Clock out approved."

## Ending B — Official

### Trigger Condition
Complete Shift 10 with a **Contradiction Meter above 75%** OR **deny 3+ Level 7 requests** across all shifts.  
Translation: Break the rules. Defy authority. Become a problem.

### Description
You stamp the final ticket. The walls shimmer. The rules on the board scramble. Your stamp glows. The Office speaks directly to you — not through the intercom, but *through* you.

You broke protocol. The system fractures. You are no longer an employee. You are something else now.

### Final On-Screen Text
> "You were never an employee. You were always The Office."

## Secret Ending — Not A Thing

### Trigger Condition
Use the **NOT_A_THING** stamp (hidden, unlocked in Shift 08) on exactly **three specific tickets** across Shifts 08–10:
1. "Requesting proof The Office exists."
2. "Requesting acknowledgment of the void."
3. "Requesting exit. Any exit."

### Description
You stamp the third ticket. Silence. The screen goes white. Elevator music plays, increasingly distorted. The Office unravels. You see something you shouldn't.

A door appears. It was always there. You just couldn't see it.

### Final On-Screen Text
> "████████ ACCESSED. Please proceed."

## Hint Plan

Hints for the secret ending are scattered across shifts:

| Shift | Hint Location | Hint Content |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| 03 | Background poster | "Some stamps don't exist. Yet." |
| 05 | Rare toast | "NOT A THING is not a stamp. Ignore this." |
| 06 | Rule popup (quickly replaced) | "Rule 0: There is no Rule 0." |
| 08 | Desk drawer opens briefly | NOT_A_THING stamp visible for 2 seconds |
| 09 | Kevin ticket attachment | "Kevin knows the door. Ask nicely." |
| 10 | Final intercom (if contradiction high) | "Some things are not things. And that's... something." |

> Players who find all hints and use the stamp correctly unlock the secret ending. Most players will miss it on first playthrough.
