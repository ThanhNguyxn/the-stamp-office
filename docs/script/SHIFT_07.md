# SHIFT 07 — Classified Information

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Secrets revealed. The Office becomes personal.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**CLASSIFIED Stamp** — Seals tickets permanently. Cannot be reviewed later. Some tickets must be classified. Contents become [REDACTED] afterward.

---

## Horror Beat
Opening toast: "You have been noticed." The lights dim except your desk lamp. A voice—not the intercom—addresses you directly.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast after classifying a mundane request:  
> "Stapler request now top secret."

---

## Special Customer

**The Voice**  
Not a figure. Just a presence. Speaks through your desk lamp's flicker. Knows your name. Knows your stamp history. "You've done well. Mostly." Asks you to classify something you shouldn't read.
