# SHIFT 03 — The Attachment Problem

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Bureaucratic complexity. Paper trails deepen.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Attachments Matter** — Tickets now have attachments that affect validity. Must cross-reference attachment content with rules before stamping.

---

## Horror Beat
One attachment is a photo of your desk. Taken from behind you. No one else is in the room.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast after denying a ticket with 47 pages of justification:  
> "All 47 pages have been noted. Briefly."

---

## Special Customer

**The Archivist**  
A humanoid figure made entirely of manila folders. Speaks in file names. Delivers a "priority attachment" that's just an empty envelope. Insists it's very important. Leaves without explanation.
