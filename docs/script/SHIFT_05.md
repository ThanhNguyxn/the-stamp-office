# SHIFT 05 — The Meter Rises

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Tension builds. Doing "right" feels wrong.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Contradiction Meter** — A visible meter appears on screen. Following rules correctly increases it. Breaking rules decreases it. Neither choice feels safe.

---

## Horror Beat
The Contradiction Meter fills to 50%. The screen desaturates briefly. A toast appears: "This is fine." It isn't fine.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast when meter hits 25%:  
> "Consistency detected. Suspicious."

---

## Special Customer

**The Auditor**  
A floating clipboard with a single unblinking eye. Reviews your previous stamp history. Comments on patterns. "You approved 73% of requests. Interesting." Leaves a ticket requesting you audit yourself.
