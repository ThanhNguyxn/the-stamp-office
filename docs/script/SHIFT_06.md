# SHIFT 06 — Retroactive Action

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Reality bends. The past is negotiable.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**RETROACTIVE Stamp** — Can be applied to already-processed tickets. Changes their outcome after the fact. Reality adjusts accordingly.

---

## Horror Beat
You use RETROACTIVE on a ticket. The room flickers. For one frame, there are two of you at the desk. Then there's one again.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast after first RETROACTIVE:  
> "Timeline updated. Déjà vu is normal."

---

## Special Customer

**The Corrector**  
A figure that walks backwards into the room. Speaks in past tense about future events. "You will have approved this yesterday." Delivers tickets already stamped by you—except you haven't seen them yet.
