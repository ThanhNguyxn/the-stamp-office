# SHIFT 08 — About You

**Target Duration:** 10–12 minutes  
**Tone:** Intimate. Uncomfortable. The Office knows too much.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Forms About YOU** — Tickets now reference your stamp history, your contradictions, your patterns. You're reviewing paperwork about yourself.

---

## Horror Beat
A ticket arrives requesting your termination. Signed by you. Dated tomorrow.

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast when approving your own vacation request:  
> "Self-approval noted. Conflict of interest ignored."

---

## Special Customer

**Future You (Maybe)**  
A figure that looks like you but slightly off. Wrong posture. Smiles too wide. Delivers your own personnel file. "You'll understand soon." Leaves before you can respond. You're not sure they used the door.
