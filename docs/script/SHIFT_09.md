# SHIFT 09 — Pressure Cooker

**Target Duration:** 12–14 minutes  
**Tone:** Everything accelerates. Stakes crystallize.

---

## Core Mechanic Introduced
**Speed Mode** — Tickets arrive faster. Toasts stack. Rules update mid-ticket. Mistakes compound. The pressure is intentional.

---

## Horror Beat
The Contradiction Meter briefly shows 99%. Then resets to your actual value. A toast: "Just checking."

---

## Comedy Beat
System toast when three tickets arrive simultaneously:  
> "Multitasking unlocked. Regret included."

---

## Special Customer

**Everyone**  
Every previous special customer appears briefly—Orientation Guide, Archivist, Mediator, Auditor, Corrector, The Voice, Future You. None speak. They watch. Kevin's empty desk chair spins slowly.
