# Meme Safety

The Stamp Office uses **meme-echo** humor: original jokes inspired by internet culture, never copied formats.

---

## Evergreen Humor Rules

1. **Universal setup** — The joke should land for someone who's never seen the source material.
2. **No expiration date** — Avoid references that require 2024-specific context.
3. **Owned by The Office** — Every joke should feel like it belongs in this world.
4. **Replayable** — If it's only funny once, reconsider it.

## What to Avoid

❌ Real meme templates (Distracted Boyfriend, Drake format, etc.)  
❌ Copyrighted characters or phrases  
❌ Platform-specific slang that dates quickly ("slay," "no cap")  
❌ References to real celebrities, politicians, or brands  
❌ Inside jokes that only work for one fandom  
❌ Rage-bait or controversy-farming humor  

---

## Fandom Placeholder Policy

If a ticket or toast references a fictional fandom:
- Use a **placeholder name** (e.g., "The Cube Saga" instead of a real franchise)
- Keep the joke structure intact
- Ensure it's funny without knowing the source

## Examples

### ✅ Good (Meme-Echo)

**Ticket request:**  
> "Requesting approval to promote Kevin to Regional Void Coordinator. He has been employee of the month for 47 consecutive months."

*Why it works:* Office absurdity, no real reference, funny without context.

---

**System toast:**  
> "Your break has been rescheduled to yesterday."

*Why it works:* Bureaucratic nonsense, universally understood, timeless.

---

### ❌ Bad (Direct Reference)

**Ticket request:**  
> "Requesting approval to use the 'This is fine' dog on internal posters."

*Why it fails:* Copyrighted meme, dates the game, not owned by The Office.

---

**System toast:**  
> "No cap, this ticket is bussin'."

*Why it fails:* Slang that will age poorly, breaks the world's tone.

---

> When in doubt: would The Office actually send this? If not, rewrite it.
